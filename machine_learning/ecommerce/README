We are given a data of an Ecommerce company that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.
Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

check the notebook ecommerce for the analysis.
I have used linear regression here to solve the problem.

also I've put the plots in a separate pdf file too. I am working on to have nice detailed plots in the file. 
work is in progress
